# File Explorer Project

A React-based File Explorer application that allows you to navigate through a file system structure, and perform basic file operations such as adding, deleting, and renaming files and folders.

## Features

- 📁 **Display File System Structure**: The project displays a file structure similar to that in Visual Studio Code, showing folders and files with proper hierarchy.
- ➕ **Add Files and Folders**: Create new files and folders within existing directories using the plus (`+`) buttons.
- ❌ **Delete Files and Folders**: Remove existing files or folders using the delete (`❌`) button.
- ✏️ **Rename Files and Folders**: Rename files and folders by clicking the edit (`✏️`) icon, entering the new name, and pressing enter.
- 📂 **Expand and Collapse Folders**: Click on folder names to expand or collapse their contents.
